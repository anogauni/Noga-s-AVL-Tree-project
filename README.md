This project was developed as part of the Data Structures course to implement and demonstrate the functionality of an AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.
This repository contains the final version of the project, including all the necessary operations to manage and manipulate the AVL Tree.

The following features are included in this project:
1. Insertion: Efficiently inserts nodes while maintaining the balance of the tree.
2. Deletion: Removes nodes from the tree, including handling cases with nodes having two children, ensuring the tree remains balanced.
3. Search: Allows for searching specific values within the tree
4. Balancing: Ensures the tree remains balanced after each insertion and deletion operation.
